                "Done".

            <div class="counter_text">
              <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>

                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                that on the board by dragging and dropping the card form one
                list to another.

                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                from the board. please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
